 binary tree:

 Syntax Tree - Constructed by compilers and (implicitly) calculators to parse expressions.
 Treap - Randomized data structure used in wireless networking and memory allocation.
 T-tree - Though most databases use some form of B-tree to store data on the drive,
 databases which keep all (most) their data in memory often use T-trees to do so.
