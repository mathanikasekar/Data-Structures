TREE:
 -non linear ds
 -collection of nodes in hierarchy from root node to subsequent nodes(parent/leaf node)
 -may b empty or have child nodes
TERMS:
 Node — structure which contain a value or condition,
  or represent a separate data structure.
 Internal node — A node with at least one child.
 Path − the sequence of nodes along the edges of a tree.
 Root − The node at the top of the tree
 only one root per tree and one path from the root node to any node.
 Parent − Any node except the root node has one edge upward to a node called parent.
 Child −node below a given node connected by its edge downward is called its child node.
 Leaf − does not have any child node
 Subtree − Subtree represents the descendants of a node.
 Height — no of edges on the "longest path" between a node and a descendant leaf.
 Breadth — The number of leaves.

 ****
 Visiting − checking the value of a node when control is on the node.
 Traversing − passing through nodes in a specific order.

 Levels − the generation of a node.
          root node is at level 0,
          then its next child node is at level 1,
          its grandchild is at level 2, and so on.

 keys − Key represents a value of a node
        based on which a search operation is to be carried out for a node.
