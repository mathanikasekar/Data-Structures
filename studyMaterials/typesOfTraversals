Tree traversal:
 -tree search
 -process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure,
  exactly once
DFS:
 -starts with the root node and first visits all nodes of one branch as deep as possible of the chosen Node
 -all nodes in the length are visited then backtracking to top then continue visiting other nodes

    each child of root is traversed to its depth
    and then backtracking to next child of root then doing the same process.
